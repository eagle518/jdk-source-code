Provides classes for creating and modifying images.
Images are processed using a streaming framework that involves an
image producer, optional image filters, and an image consumer.  This
framework makes it possible to progressively render an image while it
is being fetched and generated.  Moreover, the framework allows an
application to discard the storage used by an image and to regenerate
it at any time.  This package provides a number of image producers,
consumers, and filters that you can configure for your image
processing needs.
