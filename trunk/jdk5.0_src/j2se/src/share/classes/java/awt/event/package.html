Provides interfaces and classes for dealing with different
types of events fired by AWT components. See the java.awt.AWTEvent
class for details on the AWT event model.  Events are fired by event
sources.  An event listener registers with an event source to receive
notifications about the events of a particular type.  This package
defines events and event listeners, as well as event listener
adapters, which are convenience classes to make easier the process of
writing event listeners.
