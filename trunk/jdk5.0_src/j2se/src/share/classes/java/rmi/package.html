Provides the RMI package. RMI is Remote Method Invocation.  It is a
mechanism that enables an object on one Java virtual machine to invoke
methods on an object in another Java virtual machine.  Any object that
can be invoked this way must implement the Remote interface. When such
an object is invoked, its arguments are ``marshalled'' and sent from the
local virtual machine to the remote one, where the arguments are
``unmarshalled.''  When the method terminates, the results are
marshalled from the remote machine and sent to the caller's virtual
machine.  If the method invocation results in an exception being
thrown, the exception is indicated to caller.
