**				to rewrite!!
**	8/8/97		(dbz) Added PV_FreePgmEntries
**	8/15/97		Renamed PV_ProcessMetaMarketEvents to PV_ProcessMetaMarkerEvents. Also combined
**				sequencer processing of marker events and callback code

**				compiler generating bad code
**	9/15/97		Added GM_GetMasterSongTempo
**	9/16/97		Fixed bug in PV_ProcessController with sustain pedal. Was checking the wrong
**				mid point for off.
**	9/18/97		Modified GM_SetSongPitchOffset & GM_GetSongPitchOffset to use positive values
**				to increase pitch, and negitive values will decrease pitch
**	9/19/97		ddz Added PV_FreePatchInfo & PV_InsertBankSelect
**	9/25/97		Added TrackStatus to represent track status rather than 'R' and 'F'. Symbolic use,
**				and changed trackon to use these new symbols.

**				be muted. Also modified all functions that called PV_IsMuted to handle this condition
**	10/4/97		Flushed out GM_GetControllerValue to return more controller values
**	10/12/97	Fixed SetChannelVolume & PV_ChangeSustainedNotes & SetChannelStereoPosition &
**				SetChannelModWheel & SetChannelPitchBend & PV_SetChannelReverb to check for a

**	2/20/98		kcr		fixed bug in enabling chorus/reverb
**	3/12/98		Added vibrato and filter NRPN's cases to PV_ProcessRegisteredParameters. They
**				are not wired yet. Pulled the values from GM/GS spec sheets
**				Changed the behavior of GM_GetSongVolume. It now returns the last volume
**				even if the song is not playing
**	4/27/98		MOE: Changed calls to XDecompressPtr()
**	5/7/98		Renamed myMusicGlobals to pMixer. Added GM_SetChannelReverb & GM_GetChannelReverb.
**	5/14/98		Modified PV_ProcessMetaMarkerEvents and PV_ProcessMidiSequencerSlice to handle
**				loopstart and loopend better. Now it walks through all the tracks before reseting
**				to loop point and kills all notes that are playing and the loopend mark to eliminate
**				any hanging notes
**	5/15/98		Added trackStatusSave to the GM_Song structure will helps when doing loopstart/loopend
**	6/18/98		Modified PV_ProcessController to store the pan (10) value unmodified, but then
**				scale the GM_Voice pan value correctly
**	6/30/98		Removed the label RestartTrackProcess in PV_ProcessMidiSequencerSlice
**	7/6/98		Removed a compiler warning in GM_SetChannelReverb

**				cleaned up stereoPan related extras, and removed extra control overlaps.
**	7/27/98		Reenabled processExternalMidiQueue support in PV_ProcessExternalMIDIQueue
**	7/28/98		Added GM_SetSongStereoPosition & GM_GetSetStereoPosition
**				Changed meaning of processExternalMidiQueue in the GM_Mixer structure. Now its a count
**				rather than a boolean
**	8/5/98		Put wrappers around GM_GetRealtimeAudioInformation to protect against
**				MusicGlobals not being allocated
**	8/13/98		Added voiceType to GM_GetRealtimeAudioInformation
**	10/6/98		Fixed bug GM_GetControllerValue to return correct on/off value for channelSustain
**	11/9/98		Added GM_PrerollSong and change GM_BeginSong to use it.
**				Renamed NoteDur to voiceMode
**	11/30/98	Added support for omni mode in PV_ConfigureInstruments
**				Modified controller 123 to look at omni mode, and made controller 120 be the same
**				as 123
**	12/9/98		Added GM_GetPitchBend
**	12/18/98	Added auto remix of song start and reconfigure on mixer
**	1/13/99		Added some auto mix level code and voice calculation stuff
**				Changed system of auto level
**	2/24/99		Removed extra reference from GM_SetSongMetaEventCallback
**	3/5/99		Added threadContext to PV_ServeSongFade & PV_CallSongCallback &
**				PV_CallSongMetaEventCallback & GM_EndSong & PV_CallControlCallbacks &
**				PV_ProcessMidiSequencerSlice & PV_ProcessSequencerEvents
**
**	JAVASOFT
**	05.04.99	Changed calls to synth to work through a pSynth pointer so that we can direct the
**	06.21.99	calls to an external synth or the Beatnik synth.

* Since MIDI events can be queued by time stamp in the
* queue, it is possible to put a lot of events in the queue
* in advance, while the virtual device (i.e. pSong) is closed.
* When those events (and especially their pSong field),

*
* $$fb I am unsure why the pSong parameter is passed
* to this function. Originally, probably, it was meant that 
* each pSong would have its own event queue (which would be
* a better design anyway), but as it turns out, there is only
* one queue for the entire mixer for interactive events.
* We should remove the pSong parameter, and call this
* method only once in PV_ProcessSequencerEvents (instead
* of once per song).
* 
* The crash is currently prevented by removing
* all events of the to-be-closed pSong from the event queue
* with the new function QGM_ClearSongFromQueue(GM_Song). This
* is done prior to freeing the pSong object.

/*
Igor Meta events
FF 7F len data -	This is the standard sequencer specific data block. We can use it this way. Sequencers
ignore this data, but will not let you edit it in any way. I've tried other meta id's and
the results are the same.  Most dont even display that its present. But it does allow
us to work with blocks of 8 bit data. The only way we can set it up for a sequencer
to copy and paste our block is to make it a sysex. Which means 7 bit bytes! Ug!

FF 7F len (this is a variable len)
Byte	Data Type
0-2		<Igor ID> This will be our MMA approved ID
3-6		4 byte command count
7-10	4 byte command ID for type of event. Message type:

FLUS - command
{
11		flush current instruments (default, you dont need to send this)
}

CACH - command
{
11		cache instruments. Issuing this will cache instruments and they will not be flushed.
}

DATA - resource
{
11-14	Number of resources included in this meta event. You can have one event per data
block, or include all the resources in 	one event.


14-		The data following will be in a block format. First there will  be a 4 byte data type ID,
followed by a 4 byte ID, a pascal string (first byte is length, then data), and then a 4 byte
resource length, then the resource data. The length is only the length of the resource data.

Types:
snd( )	Standard Macintosh snd resource type. When building ALWAYS put snd's first
ID		ID reference number that is referenced in the INST resources
NAME	pascal string containing resource name
LENGTH
DATA

csnd	Standard Macintosh snd resource type that is compressed When building ALWAYS put snd's first
ID		ID reference number that is referenced in the INST resources
NAME	pascal string containing resource name
LENGTH
DATA

SONG	Igor Standard song performance resource
ID		Doesnt matter. Should only be one song per midi file
NAME	pascal string containing resource name
LENGTH
DATA

INST	Igor Standard external instrument resource
ID		Patch number to replace
NAME	pascal string containing resource name
LENGTH
DATA
