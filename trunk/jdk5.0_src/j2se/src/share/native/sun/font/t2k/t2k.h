#ifdef T2K_DOCUMENTATION
-------------------------
Q1) What files do I need to look at ?
A1) First you need to familiarize yourself with this file "T2K.H"."T2K.H" contains
documentation, a coding example and the actual T2K API.
Second you need to look at "CONFIG.H". "CONFIG.H" is the only file you normally
need to edit. The file configures T2K for your platform, and it enables
or disables optional features, and it allows you to build debug or non-debug versions.
The file itself contains more information. Turn off features you do not need in order
to minimize the size of the T2K font engine.
-------------------------
Q2) What is the basic principle for the usage of T2K API?
A2) The basic idea is that T2K was designed to be object oriented, even though the
actual implementation is only using ANSI C. This means that you will be creating
a number of objects when you use T2K. All classes have a constructor and destructor.
It is important that you call the proper destructor when you are done with a particular
object.
-------------------------
Q3) What is the best way of getting T2K going on a new platform ?
A3) It is best to first configure "CONFIG.H" and then look at the
coding example below at T2K_DOCUMENTATION_CODING_EXAMPLE.
We recommend that you start "outside in".

First create and destroy a "Memhandler" object:
(This is the "outermost" object.)

	tsiMemObject *mem = NULL;

	mem	= tsi_NewMemhandler( &errCode );
	assert( errCode == 0 );

	/* Destroy the Memhandler object. */
	tsi_DeleteMemhandler( mem );
	
Next create an InputStream object.
	tsiMemObject *mem = NULL;
	InputStream *in = NULL;

	mem	= tsi_NewMemhandler( &errCode );
	assert( errCode == 0 );

		in 	= New_InputStream3( mem, data1, size1, &errCode ); /* otherwise do this if you allocated the data  */
		assert( errCode == 0 );
		
		/* Destroy the InputStream object. */
		Delete_InputStream( in, &errCode  );
		
	/* Destroy the Memhandler object. */
	tsi_DeleteMemhandler( mem );
	
Next you would create the "sfntClass" object and then finally the "T2K" scaler object.
-------------------------
Q4) Ok, then what do I do with the T2K scaler object ?
A4) First you need to set the "transformation" with the
T2K_NewTransformation() call/method. Basically you specify the
pointsize, x and y resolution, and a 2*2 transformation matrix,
and true/false for if you want embedded bitmaps to be enabled.

Then you call T2K_RenderGlyph() to actually get bitmap and/or outline data.
After you are done with the output data you need to call T2K_PurgeMemory to
free up memory.
-------------------------
Q5)	So I call T2K_RenderGlyph(), but where do I get access to the bitmap data ?
A5) You get access to the bitmap data through public fields in the T2K class/structure.
Find the following fields:
	/* Begin bitmap data */
	tt_int32 width, height;
	F26Dot6 fTop26Dot6, fLeft26Dot6;
	tt_int32 rowBytes;
	unsigned char *baseAddr; /* unsigned char baseAddr[N], 	N = t->rowBytes * t->height */
#ifdef ENABLE_T2KE
	tt_uint32 *baseARGB;
#endif /* ENABLE_T2KE */
	/* End bitmap data */
	
baseAddr is either a bit-array, or a byte array.
baseARGB is a 32 bit array (ARGB). baseARGB is still experimental and not released.
-------------------------
Q6)	Can you give me a simple/naive example of how to actually draw a character ?
A6) Ok, something like this should work:
/*
 *	Slow naive example on how to get bitmap data from the T2K scaler object.
 *  The example assumes a screen-coordinate system where the top leftmost position on the screen is 0,0.

Q7)	How do I draw a string with the above MyDrawCharExample() ?
A7) 
	F16Dot16 x, y;
	
	x = y = 12 << 16;
	while (characters to draw..)
		/* Render the character */
		T2K_RenderGlyph( scaler, charCode, 0, 0, GREY_SCALE_BITMAP_HIGH_QUALITY, T2K_SCAN_CONVERT,  &errCode );
		assert( errCode == 0 );
		/* Now draw the character */
		MyDrawCharExample( scaler, ((x + 0x8000)>> 16) + (scaler->fLeft26Dot6 >> 6), ((y + 0x8000)>> 16) - (scaler->fTop26Dot6 >>6)  );
		x += scaler->xAdvanceWidth16Dot16;	/* advance the pen forward */
		/* Free up memory */
		T2K_PurgeMemory( scaler, 1, &errCode );
		assert( errCode == 0 );
	}
-------------------------
Q8)	How do I get grey-scale or monochrome output ?
A8) For monochrome output set 5th input parameter to T2K_RenderGlyph called greyScaleLevel equal to BLACK_AND_WHITE_BITMAP. 
	To get grey-scale output set 5th input parameter to T2K_RenderGlyph called greyScaleLevel equal to GREY_SCALE_BITMAP_HIGH_QUALITY.
-------------------------
Q9) My output device support grey-scale. Should I use it ?
A9) Yes for the best quality and end-user experience you should use grey-scale whenever possible.
-------------------------
Q10) How do I turn the T2K run-time hinting on or off.
A10) It is enabled by turning on the T2K_GRID_FIT bit in the 6th input parameterto T2K_RenderGlyph called cmd.
	 It is disabled by turning off the T2K_GRID_FIT bit in the 6th input parameterto T2K_RenderGlyph called cmd.
-------------------------
Q11) When should the T2K run-time hinting be on or off.
A11) For monochrome output your probably mostly want to turn it on.
     For a high quality display device such as a computer monitor you should probably turn it on.
     For a device such as a TV monitor you should turn it off.
-------------------------
Q12) I am using an interlacing TV as the output device. How do I make it look good.
A12) First turn off grid-fitting to get an image with less sharp transitions. (This also speeds up T2K)
	 Then turn on T2K_TV_MODE if you use integer metrics and do not use fractional positioning to improve the quality.
     Then you most likely also want to experiment with a simple filter to make the image
     more blurry. A simple 3*3 convolution is probably sufficient. You should
     probably "average" more in the y-direction than the x-direction to avoid the
     interlacing flicker. Alternatively your HW may have alrady have this built in.

-------------------------
Q13) A T2K call/method returned an error. What should the code do ?
A13) T2K automatically deletes all of its objects when it hits an error.
This means that all references to T2K objects become invalid, and can no
longer be used.
-------------------------
Q14) I noticed that there are a lot of asserts in the code...Why ?
A14) Asserts are in the code to detect/prevent programmer errors. The idea is that an
assert should never happen in real life. They are only there to catch programmer errors.
In a release build you need to turn off asserts in "CONFIG.H" to increase speed and
to reduce the code size. However in debug builds please leave it on, to ensure that
everything is working as intended.
-------------------------
Q15) How do I decide what mapping table to use in a TrueType or T2K font ?
A15) Use Set_PlatformID( scaler, ID ), and Set_PlatformSpecificID( scaler, ID ) 
To use the Unicode mapping used by Windows do the following:
Set_PlatformID( scaler, 3 );
Set_PlatformSpecificID( scaler, 1 );
-------------------------
Q16) Can you explain the second parameter called code to T2K_RenderGlyph ?
A16) Yes, this normally specifies the character code for the character you wish to render.
     However if you wish to use the glyph index instead then set the T2K_CODE_IS_GINDEX
     bit in the 6th input parameter to T2K_RenderGlyph called cmd. The glyph index is
     simply a number from 0 to N-1, assuming the font contains N glyphs.
     (N = T2K_GetNumGlyphsInFont( scaler );)
-------------------------
Q17) Does the outline winding direction matter in T2K.
A17) Yes Postscript outlines should use the correct winding direction and
     TrueType and T2K outlines also need to use the correct winding direction
     which is actually the opposite of the Postscript direction. It matters because
     the run-time-hinting process use this information to figure out where the
     black and white areas are. For TrueType and T2K the direction should be such
     that if you follow a contour in the direction of increasing point numbers
     then the black(inside) area should be on your right.
-------------------------
Q18) I need my fonts to be as small as possible. What should I do ?
A18) You need to contact Type Solutions to have them translated to
     T2K format.
-------------------------
Q19) Can you explain ALGORITHMIC_STYLES in CONFIG.H ?
A19) Yes it enables algorithmic styling.
	 The 5th parameter to New_sfntClassLogical(); T2K_AlgStyleDescriptor *styling
	 is normally set to NULL, but if ALGORITHMIC_STYLES is enabled you can set
	 it equal to an algoritmic style descriptor. Here is an example using the
	 algorithmic bolding provided by T2K.
	 
	 Original T2K Styling () ( "ENABLE_TT_HINTING" not defined ): ==>> 
	 			
						style.StyleFunc			= 	tsi_SHAPET_BOLD_GLYPH;
						style.StyleMetricsFunc	=	tsi_SHAPET_BOLD_METRICS;
						style.params[0] = 5L << 14;
						sfnt0 = New_sfntClassLogical( mem, fontType, 0, in, &style, &errCode );
						
			You can also write your own outline based style modifications and use them instead
			of the algorithmic bolding provided by T2K. Just model them after the Type Solutions
			code for algoritmic bolding in "SHAPET.c".
	
	Style with Hinting: ( "ENABLE_TT_HINTING" IS defined ): ==>> 
			
	 			The new style mechanism uses a different routine name, and different parameters.
	 			In the file shapet.h, shapet.c, see the discussion on the parameters for StyleFuncPost, and for
	 			writing your own StyleFuncPost routines..
	 			
	 			
		  		styling.StyleFuncPost			= (void *)	tsi_SHAPET_BoldItalic_GLYPH_Hinted;
				styling.StyleMetricsFunc	=	tsi_SHAPET_BOLD_METRICS;
				styling.params[0] = boldValue; 		/* Fixed point value 1.0  boldValue  about 4.0: 1.33 is good */
													/* Use 1.0 = hexadecimal 0x10000L for no action (or don't use styling) */
				styling.params[1] = italicValue;	/* Fixed point value -2.0  iitalicValue  about 2.0: .7 is good */
													/* Use  0  for no effect. Notice that slight negative values are good. */
 				(Use the same call to 	New_sfntClassLogical, as shown above )
 				
-------------------------
Q20) What is the story with USE_NON_ZERO_WINDING_RULE in CONFIG.H ?
A20) The recommended setting is to leave it on.  This determines what
kind of fill rule the T2K scan-converter will use. This enables
a non-zero winding rule, otherwise the scan-converter will use an even-odd
filling rule. For example the even-odd filling rule will turn an area
where two strokes overlap (rare) into white, but the non zero winding
rule will keep such areas black. For an embedded system where the fonts
are well build and you do not have overlapping strokes you will get a
small (proably less than 1%) speed-up by disabling this.
-------------------------
Q21) In the internal part of the options, there is an option called SAMPO_TESTING_T2K (!)
which should be disabled. The only thing it does is to enable ENABLE_WRITE and ENABLE_PRINTF.
But those two options are enabled unconditionally at the top of "don't touch" part. What is going on?
A21) :-) You should leave it off, since it is in the "don't touch" part.
When T2K is built as a font engine T2K_SCALER is defined.(Not when built as a translator)
 ifdef T2K_SCALER
actually does an  undef ENABLE_PRINTF and an  undef ENABLE_WRITE
Since the T2K font engine never does disk writes and does not use printf statements.
However, when the code is undergoing testing at Type Solutions the
T2K font engine may write to disk for logging purposes and use printf statements.
-------------------------
Q22) Are the functions used in the T2K_DOCUMENTATION_CODING_EXAMPLE part of t2k.h the only public APIs?
     Are there any other functions that might be useful to know? 
A22) Yes, but the idea is that you should only use functions/methods visible in T2K.H.
     For instance T2K_MeasureTextInX() may be useful for quickly determining lengths of text string.
     If you find a need to use something else then let us know and if it makes sense
     we may bring out a public way to do it.
     Do not rely on any function/methods outside of T2K since they may change from release to release.
-------------------------
Q23) I found that when a string contains a space, T2K_RenderGlyph returns NULL baseAddr. Why is that?
     Do I have to check the existence of space characters and advance x position accordingly?
A23) There is no bitmap to draw! Makes sense :-).
     Do not check for space, etc. just check for baseAddr == NULL instead 
	 In the future with T2KE check for ( baseARGB == NULL && baseAddr == NULL )
-------------------------
Q24) Are there functions for measuring widths and other metrics of strings
     (such as X11s XTextWidth, and XTextExtent) ?
A24) I think the closest to XTextWidth is T2K_MeasureTextInX in T2K.H
     (It measures the linear un-hinted width, it can not measure the hinted width without actually
     rendering the characters)
     There is no equivalent to X11s XTExtExtent, since this sort of function typically would need
     to be implemented on top of the font-bit-map cache. T2K does not cache the output data,
     so T2K clients typically implement a cache on top of T2K so that the second time a character is
     requested it can come directly from the cache without invoking T2K. This sort of cache makes things
     go fast. String wide functions should be implemented so that they request information from the
     cache, to avoid T2K having to recompute everything several times. 
	 T2K also has two early experimental functions called T2K_GetIdealLineWidth(), T2K_LayoutString().
	 They can help you to layout an entire line so that the total width is the ideal linear width, while
	 still using run-time hinted individual characters and metrics. At least is attempts to do this
	 by mostly putting the nonlinearities into the space characters between the words.
-------------------------
Q25) Can I edit T2K_BLACK_VALUE, and T2K_WHITE_VALUE so that I get a different range for the grey-scale ?
A25) No, you should not edit anything in T2K.H. They are there so that you can put in an assert in your
     code so that you can automatically detect if they are ever changed by Type Solutions in the future.
-------------------------
Q26) What does T2K_TV_MODE do?
A26) See future T2K release.
-------------------------
Q27) What next ?
A27) Go try the code. Good Luck! :-)
